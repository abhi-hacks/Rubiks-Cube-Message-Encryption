Terry didn't consider himself particularly unusual. Sure, he spent his teenage years as a willing and sometimes absurdly cheerful social outcast, upon adulthood immediately transitioned to playing side-kick to a magic-savvy private investigator, accidentally became the confidant of an apparently ageless time-traveler, and just recently declared war on a corporation widely recognized as one of the top ten charitable organizations in the world, but he figured most people had a few weird phases in their lives.
